                        <p>
                            The goal of this Travel Program is to prepare players
                            for the recruiting process and to provide aspiring student-athletes
                            with opportunities to earn athletic/academic scholarships.
                            Our staff is in constant communication with Universities all across
                            North America who are eager to recruit PCL's athletes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            We will host 4 hours of try-outs to evaluate and select
                            the top team made up of 16 players and 2 goalies. Try-out fee - $25
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The team selected will be put to the test in an intense eight week,
                            14-hour program preparing for one of two heavily recruited tournaments
                            which will be decided upon by the parents, players coaches and program
                            directors. Before a decision is made, the pros and cons of both events
                            will be laid out by the program director, Tyler Pace. Each player will
                            learn how to become a more appealing recruit by preparing for college
                            lacrosse on and off the field.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every player will receive monthly progress reports,
                            healthy meals/snacks/supplements suggestions and an 8-week workout plan.
                            We will also host an optional, themed Zoom meeting bi-weekly to build
                            relationships between players and coaches, speak with special guests,
                            learn to create highlight tapes, do chalk-talk, etc..

                        <p>
                            The boys will also have the option to join in via Zoom to Scholastic
                            Aptitude Test (SAT) preparation classes taught by a high-school teacher
                            who played NCAA soccer and who understands strategies to score more
                            successfully on the test.

                            Parents will receive a breakdown of what the recruiting process looks l
                            ike, scholarship expectations, information on the NCAA Clearing House,
                            and NCAA recruiting rules and information (DI, DII, DIII). We ask that
                            parents provide us with monthly academic progress reports from their
                            son's councillor so that we can do a better job of helping to work with
                            each individual based on their athletic and academic abilities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The pedigree of our coaching staff is our most significant separating
                            factor. Team Canada, PLL, NLL, MLL, NCAA, our staff has not only done it
                            all, but they continue to do it. With 4-6 coaches present at every session,
                            each having extensive coaching experience in their own rights and who brings
                            a unique skillset and approach to the game, we can provide different perspectives
                            on what it takes to be a successful lacrosse player.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Since the high-level recruiting events take place during the NLL season,
                            many of our coaches are unable to attend travel events. With this in mind,
                            two "travelling coaches" will work alongside our current pros at every session.
                            The team will travel with those twocoaches as well as two managers who will
                            have their travel expenses covered by program fees.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Our annual "Pro-D Jamboree" is still in question with the status of
                            COVID-19. If we are able to host the event, the team will participate in
                            front of recruiters as a "warm-up" to build in-game chemistry leading
                            up to the travel tournament.

                        We ask that parents provide us with monthly academic progress reports
                        from their son'scouncillor so that we can do a better job of helping
                        to work with each individual based on their athletic and academic abilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The pedigree of our coaching staff is our most significant separating factor.
                        Team Canada, PLL, NLL, MLL, NCAA, our staff has not only done it all, but they
                        continue to do it. With 4-6 coaches present at every session, each having
                        extensive coaching experience in their own rights and who brings a unique
                        skillset and approach to the game, we can provide different perspectives on what
                        it takes to be a successful lacrosse player.

                    <p>
                        Since the high-level travel events take place during the NLL season, many of
                        our coaches are unable to attend travel events. With this in mind, two "travelling coaches"
                        will work alongside our current pros at every session. The team will travel with
                        those twocoaches as well as two managers who will have their travel expenses covered by program
                        fees.

                        Our annual "Pro-D Jamboree" is still in question with the status of COVID-19.
                        If we are able to host the event, the team will participate in front of recruiters
                        as a "warm-up" to build in-game chemistry leading up to travel event.
